1. Overview of the analysis:

2. Results:

* Data Preprocessing
  * What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
  * What variable(s) are the features for your model?
  * What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?

* Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
  * How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
  * Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
  * What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
